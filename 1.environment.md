# Installing a Python dev environment

## git and github

- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
(choose [git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on Windows): git is a versioning system used to manage the source code of software projects such as scikit-learn and NumPy.

- [Create an account on github.com](https://github.com): github is a platform to work collaboratively on the source code of hosted Open Source projects such as scikit-learn and NumPy.

- [Create an SSH key for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 

Once you have a github account and installed the `git` command on your system, open a new terminal session (use Git Bash under Windows) type the following commands.

- Fork scikit-learn in the github web interface: go to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn and click the "fork" button. You should be automatically redirected to your personal fork at:  https://github.com/myusername/scikit-learn in your web browser.

- Then, in the terminal clone your fork with git:

  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git
  ```

  Note that the `$` sign is a generic prompt indicator for terminal commands. Please do not copy it when you copy-paste commands from this document.

- Many open source projects from the Python ecosystem share similar development practices. For instance, you can also (optionally) clone numpy with git if you want to use the development version of numpy instead of a released package:
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:myusername/numpy/numpy.git
  ```
  
- After cloning those repo, you should see a new local folders with your clones in the output of the `ls` command:

  ```
  $ ls
  ```
  
- To locate those folder, use the `pwd` (path to working directory) command:

  ```
  $ pwd
  ```

- Configure some aliases for the remote repositories:

  List existing remotes in your scikit-learn clone:
  ```
  $ cd scikit-learn
  $ git remote -v
  ```
  You should a similar output to:
  ```
  origin          git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git (fetch)
  origin          git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git (push)
  ```
  
  Add a new remote for the reference scikit-learn repository on GitHub
  (i.e `scikit-learn/scikit-learn`) which is conventionally called `upstream`:
  ```
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
  ```
  
  Check that your the remote has been properly configured:
  ```
  $ git remote -v
  ```
  You should now get a similar output to:
  ```
  origin          git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git (fetch)
  origin          git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git (push)
  upstream        git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git (fetch)
  upstream        git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git (push)
  ```
  

## conda

Conda is a command line tool to download software packages and work in isolated environements for different projects.

The fastest way to install the conda tool is to use a miniforge installer.

### Install Miniforge

- Install Miniforge from
[the official installation page](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge) (choose the latest Miniforge installer links for your Operating System version)

- Initialize the conda command in git bash
  - Windows: open "Git Bash" and type
  ```
  $ cd Downloads/
  $ ./Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe
  ```
  - Linux & macOS:
  ```
  $ cd Downloads/
  $ bash Miniforge3-*.sh
  ```

  And follow the instructions.

- Make sure your initialized your shell environment:

  - Windows (with Git Bash) and Linux
  ```
  $ conda init bash
  ```

  - macOS uses zsh instead of bash by default:
  ```
  $ conda init zsh
  ```

- then close your shell and start a new one to type:
  
  ```
  $ conda info
  ```

  and look for the location of the "base environment".

  or
  
  ```
  $ where conda
  ```
  to check that the conda command is in your PATH and useable from your shell.

### conda environments

conda environments make it possible to have specific versions of your packages to work on a specific project independently of the dependencies used for other projects. Once your are done with a project it's very easy to delete a conda environment to avoid accumulating packages you no longer need on your system.

conda environments also make it easy to make sure that the versions of the packages you use on your developer environment matchs those used by your team members or those required by the production environment for instance.

- create an environment named `sklworkshop`:
```
$ conda create --name sklworkshop -c conda-forge numpy scipy cython joblib threadpoolctl pytest matplotlib pandas
```

if your are on macOS you should add the `compilers` packages to that list:

```
$ conda create --name sklworkshop -c conda-forge numpy scipy cython joblib threadpoolctl pytest matplotlib pandas compilers
```

Note: the `-c conda-forge` flag is not necessary if you installed conda with the miniforge installer, but it is necessary if you use a conda command installed from the Miniconda or Anaconda installers.

- activate and deactivate environments
```
$ conda activate sklworkshop
(sklworkshop)$ conda deactivate
```
- version, environment and package listing
```
$ conda --version
$ conda env list
$ conda list
```

## VS Code

VS Code is a very popular open source code editor with a rich set of extensions to turn it into a full fledged Integrated Development Environment (with fast code navigation, auto completion, pytest execution, debugger, jupyter notebook editing and execution...).

Here we show the main tips and tricks to get productive when using VS Code to work on Python projects such as scikit-learn (including the most useful keyboard shortcuts).

Install VSCode following the
[instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview#_cross-platform) for your Operating System.

Launch VS Code. At the first start you might get a popup to ask you to configure [Telemetry settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry). Feel free to disable telemetry if you don't want VS Code to report any data to its developers.

Install the Python extension:
- `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the extension manager
- search for the python extension: install

Note to macOS users: replace `Ctrl` by `Command` on most of the keyboard short-cuts presented in this document.

Open project folder for scikit-learn: `Ctrl+Shift+P` then type: "File: Open Folder..." and open the `scikit-learn` folder your create when running the `git clone` command above.

Open a Python file from the project by clicking on `setup.py` in the left panel named "EXPLORER".

In order to work with VSCode in your Python environment
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` then "python select interpreter" and choose "sklworkshop"

Optionally, you can open a new project folder for NumPy similarly: `Ctrl+Shift+P` then type: "File: Open Folder..." and select the `numpy` folder.

Activate the "sklworkshop" Python interpreter for the numpy project as well.

Switch between projects: `Ctrl-r`

Browse the code:
- by files `Ctrl-p`
- by symbols `Ctrl-t`

At some point VSCode will complain about not finding a linter: scikit-learn uses `flake8`
- Install `flake8` in your conda environment
```
$ conda activate sklworkshop
(sklworkshop)$ conda install flake8
```
- Select `flake8` as a linter in VS Code: `Ctrl-Shift-P` "select linter"

## Practical code navigation

Find example files that mention the word "importance" in different ways:
- VS Code: `Ctrl-P` "example importance" and open `examples/plot_permutation_importance.py`
- GitHub: go to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn in your browser, press `t` and type "example/importance"

Navigate to the `RandomForestClassifier` class from the `plot_permutation_importance.py` example:
- VS Code: ctrl-clicking on the class name
- GitHub: clicking on the class name

Find the class `KMeans` in scikit-learn in two different ways:
- from the command line, in a bash or zsh terminal: use `git grep "class KMeans"` (note that using the "class" prefix makes the search more specific to only find the line of the class definition. Otherwise you will find all occurrences of the KMeans class, including in documentation, tests, examples...). When your are not sure about the casing, use the `git grep -i "keyword"` for case insensitive search instead.
- VS Code: `Ctrl-t` and type "KMeans". If nothing happens, press `Enter`, and select the `KMeans` class from the list of suggestions.

## Installing C/C++ compilers to be able to build native extensions

Building scikit-learn from source requires a C/C++ compiler (to build native extensions
typically written in Cython for instance).

If you have never installed a C/C++ compiler for your system you need to do it now.

**macOS users:** feel free to install the `compilers` package from conda-forge in your
environment if your did not do it already. After installation, you need to deactivate
and reactivate your environment for this installation to be effective.

```
$ conda install -n sklworkshop compilers
$ conda deactivate
$ conda activate sklworkshop
```
